# Dari, Find your own house from all over the world.

> This website is about allowing users to find rents from all over the world, for now, it is just static but maybe in the future, I will make it dynamic who knows. This project consists of one search Page, a search result Page, and a details Page. I developed all of them on my own using HTML, CSS, and bootstrap. The site is responsive to laptop, tablet, and mobile resolutions. I added a small bit of JS to import a Google maps API on the details page to show where the location of the house to the users.
